= Developing Microservices With Spring Boot 

This is the code accompanying the Livelessons video training course, https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/building-microservices-with/9780134192468/[_Building Microservices with Spring Boot_],
by http://twitter.com/starbuxman[Josh Long] and http://twitter.com/phillip_webb[Phil Webb]. 

NOTE: We're currently upgrading this codebase for a second video. Please use the `v1` branch if you want to see the previous version.

== Introduction
What makes a modern application? A modern application lives on the web. It
lives in the cloud. It works with all manner of data (big-data, NoSQL,
in-memory data-grids). It is service-oriented and multi-client ready. It is
production-ready. It is driven by ever-changing demands and scale.

While it's true that it may no longer be a "Spring" chicken, Spring's maturity
is well-proven and powering some of the largest and widely used open-web
applications in the world! And, with the introduction of Spring Boot, it's
lighter and more productive than ever.
