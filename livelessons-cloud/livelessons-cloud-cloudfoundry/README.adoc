= Lesson 3: Reaching For The Clouds (Cloud Foundry)

== Introduction
This example shows how you can push a Spring Boot application to Cloud Foundry. You
will need a https://run.pivotal.io/[Cloud Foundry account] and the
http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/installcf/[`cf` command line tool] installed.

== Pushing to Cloud Foundry
You can build and push the application as follows:

```
$ mvn clean package
$ cf push <appname> -p target/livelessons-cloud-cloudfoundry-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
